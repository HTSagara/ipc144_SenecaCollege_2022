1. What you have learned in completing this workshop?
	I've learned the basic use of softwares, such as Visual Studio, FileZilla and PuTTY, how to use the function printf 
	and how I can print special characters like back-slash, percent and double-quote.
	And last but not least, commands on the Command Prompt like ls (used to list files), cd (to change directory), 
	and mkdir (to create a new directory).

2. Briefly describe what SSH is and how you used it in this workshop
	The SSH is the software used to interact and navigate on the Seneca's server through my local computer.
	It was used in this project to:
	- Create the directories ipc144 and w01;
	- To run and test the code;

	Without the SSH nothig it wouldn't be possible to do it in the Seneca's server from outside Seneca.
